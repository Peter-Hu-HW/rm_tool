## Pipeline
ack > search_res.log

src/main.c process the log (read and rm)

remove specific lines using Linux system call.

sed -i '4d' 'test/fops.h'
sed -i '1,2d' 'test/fops.c'

generate deletedLog with timestamp.

**buffer** size fixed at 1000.
## Choiceï¼š
1. skip
2. rm variable/single line <br/>
    v1:No need to flush, since it's restricted to a subset of lines.

    v2: Direct flushing, enabling multiple choices
3. vim  <br/>
    flush -> redo ack search
4. rm specific lines  <br/>
    v1: Delete Multiple Lines is asynchronous, it will trigger flush and reload by design <br/>
    ADD acknowledge confirmation, and could AVOID future warning by using variable  bool future_acknowledge=true; <br/>

    v2: No need to flush deleteList this time.
5. ack
6. rm file
7. rm function, declaration

Determine whether or not to flush deleteList and searchList depend on the properties of the function, whether it will read / write the state.
