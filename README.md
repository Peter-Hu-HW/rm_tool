## Pipeline
ack > search_res.log

src/main.c process the log (read and rm)

remove specific lines using Linux system call.

sed -i '4d' 'test/fops.h'
sed -i '1,2d' 'test/fops.c'

## Choiceï¼š
1. skip
2. rm variable/single line <br/>
    No need to flush, since it's restricted to a subset of lines.
3. vim  <br/>
    flush -> redo ack search
4. rm specific lines  <br/>
    Delete Multiple Lines is asynchronous, it will trigger flush and reload by design <br/>
    ADD acknowledge confirmation, and could AVOID future warning by using variable  bool future_acknowledge=true; <br/>
5. ack
6. rm file
7. rm function
